# ECE650 : Assignment 4

Replace FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, WATIAM, and STUDENT_ID, EMAIL in
`user.yml` by your first and last name, WatIAM id, student number, and
email, respectively. Whenever possible, please use ASCII characters.

Do not change the format `user.yml`. We will parse it
automatically. Only enter the information requested.

The main file for your solution to the assignment should be
`ece650-a4.cpp`. You can use `test.cpp` for your unit tests.

You will need to checkout minisat to the main directory of the project.
You can do this using

```
git clone https://github.com/agurfinkel/minisat
```


You might need to modify `CMakeLists.txt` if you are adding additional
source files for your code and/or tests.

Commit your changes and submit on GitHub.
